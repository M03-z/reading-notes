HTML pages are text documents.

HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

Tags are often referred to as elements.

Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

Attributes require a name and a value.

DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using

You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.

The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. X Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
